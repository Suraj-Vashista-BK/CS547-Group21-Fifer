<b>Explaining The Problem</b>:

Given the California Unemployment data set between 1976 and 2021, we are designing a model to predict the unemployment rate for the latest decade.

Out of the given data, we have extracted the columns that provide us the highest value to perform the prediction.

The final columns are:
Month
Year
Area
Total Labor Force
Employment 
Unemployment 
Area Type

Since, our aim is to predict the unemployment rate, that becomes our label.
Label: unemployment rate  

Our data set initially consisted of 191127 rows and after preprocessing, we are now with a dataset of 173432 rows. We will be performing the prediction using this dataset.
